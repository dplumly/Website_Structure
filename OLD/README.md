# Dustins-Words

Dustin’s Words is the product of our founder Matt Reamer’s love for his autistic brother, Dustin. Dustin can’t speak, and he has a hard time getting around due to a physical disability. So Matt built a device that allows him to push a button to send a text message to his mom when they are apart. Thanks to the device Matt built for his brother, Dustin can now tell his mother when he has a headache, when he’s hungry, or when he simply wants to say, “I love you.”
